        <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        The aritficial intelligence program of the PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI 
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tenserflow 2.0
        and Flask, teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, 
        and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p id="cnc">
        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like Linux,
        Dockers, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.jS, React, and React Native while introducing students to development 
        of microservices and software development techniqueds on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p id="bcc">
        <h1>Blockchain Computing</h1>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger
        (Fabric) and learn to program in languagegs such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.JS.
        The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web 3
        and Truffle and in-depth understnading of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer
        an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p id="iot">
        <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
        The Internet of Things program introduces the students to open source development technologies like
        Rust, Embedded Rust, Webassembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes while making them
        eficient in developing microservices for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and Voice Computing for device control.
